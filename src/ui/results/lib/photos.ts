/**
 * The photos of a report, in the one order every view uses (owner requests B1 + D1, final):
 *
 *   #1  the COVER ("Closest look"): the most zoomed-in CLEAR photo of the window (Sentinel-2 10 m beats Landsat
 *       30 m beats VIIRS 375 m). What counts as clear, and how equally zoomed-in photos are ranked, is
 *       src/lib/clarity.ts (shared with the globe's cover prefetch): not clouded over (spot ≠ cloud and scene
 *       cloud < 70 %) and, where the archive's per-pixel mask was read, at least 60 % of the photo's square
 *       showing the ground; ties go to the clear spot, the clearer square, the higher sun, the straighter view,
 *       then the newest. With no clear photo, a partly clear one leads the same way.
 *       · no clear DETAILED photo in the window → `report.clearCover` (the last clear Sentinel-2 / Landsat
 *         look from before the window; no pass, never counted), labelled "Last clear look";
 *       · no clear image at all → the least cloudy detailed capture, labelled "Clouded over";
 *       · no detailed capture at all → the sharpest weather mosaic (lit well, then newest).
 *   then every other photo of the window, NEWEST FIRST (by the pass's closest approach). Clouded ones stay,
 *   honestly labelled.
 *   last the geostationary frames (GOES, Himawari, Meteosat: the newest full-disc frame of each watcher, 2–5 km),
 *   under the Weather filter with the mosaics.
 *
 * Weather mosaics (250–375 m daily) are photos too. Sentinel-1's radar images are in the same order (newest first)
 * but never lead: a radar image is not a photograph, and the cover is what the results wait for. A week with only
 * radar images lists them with no cover. The gallery filter narrows the same order to Detailed (10–30 m), Weather
 * (250 m+) or Radar.
 *
 * Pure: unit-tested in lib.test.ts.
