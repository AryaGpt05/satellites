/**
 * How clear a Sentinel-2 / Landsat photo is, and which of two equally zoomed-in photos should lead (owner rule, final:
 * the first photo is the most zoomed-in CLEAR photo, then the rest newest first). Shared by the results' photo order
 * (ui/results/lib/photos.ts) and the globe's cover prefetch (globe/acquisition.ts coverPass), so the two always pick
 * the same photo. Pure.
 *
 * What counts as clear (tiers): a photo is CLOUDED OVER when the spot itself is cloud or the scene is ≥ 70 % cloud (the
 * label rule, unchanged); otherwise it is CLEAR unless the archive's per-pixel mask says under 60 % of its square shows
 * the ground (`clearFraction`, see imagery/cloud.ts), which makes it only PARTLY clear. The lead is the most zoomed-in
 * photo of the best tier present; among equally zoomed-in ones: the clear spot, then the clearer square (10 % steps),
 * then the higher sun (5° steps), then the straighter view (5° steps), then the newer. It only reorders real photos:
 * cloudy ones stay in the gallery, honestly labelled.
